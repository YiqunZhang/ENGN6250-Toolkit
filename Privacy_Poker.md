### Game Kit

#### Poker

We needed some poker cards to play as props. First, the development team needs to determine how much private data will be used in the software development process, we use $A$ to represent it. For example, `Phone Number`, `Address` and `Name` are $3$ types of private data, $A = 3$.

Then we need to know how much volunteer users will play the games, we use $B$ to represent it. For example, there are $15$ volunteer users, $B = 15$.

We need to prepare $(B+1) \times A$ poker into $B+1$ groups, $A$ in each group, each group is the same.
