# Privacy Poker

## Introduction

## Preparation

### Participants

- All developers, product managers and planners. They will learn about the user's understanding and requirements for privacy in this game.
- Some volunteer users, Recommend no less than 10 people. They will express their understanding and request for privacy in the game.

### Game Kit

#### Poker

We needed some poker cards to play as props. First, the development team needs to determine how much private data will be used in the software, we use $A$ to represent it. For example, `Phone Number`, `Address` and `Name` are $3$ types of private data, $A = 3$.

Then we need to know how much volunteer users will play the games, we use $B$ to represent it. For example, there are $15$ volunteer users, $B = 15$.

We need to prepare $(B+1) \times A$ poker into $B+1$ groups, $A$ in each group, each group is the same. You can find poker image in the appendix and print them on A4 paper. Finally, take out a set of pokers, write down the privacy required by a piece of software on each poker, and do the same operation on each set of poker.

#### Basket

We need 7 baskets, there are labels on each basket, which can be downloaded in the appendix and you can print them on A4 paper.
