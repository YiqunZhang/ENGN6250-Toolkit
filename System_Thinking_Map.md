# System Thinking Map
## Introduction

## Preparation

## Game Rule
### **1. System Entities Distribution**: 
Ten magnet stickers are distributed to each participant and a stack of magnet stickers are placed in front of the whiteboard. Whenever if one participant uses up all magnet stickers, please feel free to replenish them because the magnet stickers are enough.
### **2. Write Down Systems**: 
This is a free time to write down all possible systems or entities relevant to the current topic on the stickers, which they come up with. If one participant finish one magnet sticker, it can be placed in the white board. All participants can place their systems or entities magnet stickers on the white board to show them to everyone. **Do not take others’ magnet stickers from the white board but feel free to change the stickers’ location on the white board.** Until all participants cannot add more systems or entities on the white board, this step is over.
### **3. Drop Duplicate and Changing Time**: 
Everyone can discuss with each other to drop duplicate or unnecessary systems and entities on the white board. Once a sticker is taken from the white board, a dropping record can be added in the notebook. **A dropping record can include who take what system or entities on the white board**. Those dropping records can be discussed in the later stage.
### **4. Connection**: 
In this stage, every participant can stand in the front of the white board together to draw lines from one system to another system to identify the connection between them. Once the connection is established, participants can write a words or short terms to describe the connection and add it on the connection line, which can help other people learn about the connection faster. **Of course, the stickers can be moved on the white board but must keep the exist connections are correct.** In this step, the connection among different systems can be visualized on the white board to let all participants widen their thought and learn from each other about system thinking. Until all participants cannot add more connection on the white board, this step is over.
### **5. Output and Comments**: 
After all brainstorm and discussion, a highly completed system thinking map appear on the white board. This is a work done together and everyone can make comments about the map and record the comments on the notebook.

## Discussion and Review
In this stage, everyone is invited to share their opinions about the game and answer some questions. The questions can be presented on the screen and there is 15 minutes thinking time for everyone consider the questions following:
1.	If there is some dropping records and comments made by you on the notebook, explain why making the decisions.
2.	What systems or entities are the most important in this topic, and what are the least important and why?
3.	Do you think some connection or systems can be improved in current map? Why?
4.	What can you learn from this activity about the system thinking?
5.	What will you do system thinking in the future work?
6.	Which partner do the best in this activity and how can you learn from him or her?  
**Award (Optional):**
If someone is considered as the one who do the best in this activity after all participants' sharing, some award like gifts or cash can be added to encourage.
